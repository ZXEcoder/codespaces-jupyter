## Introduction

Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical business metric for many companies. It refers to the loss of customers or subscribers who cease using a company's product or service. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses as it allows them to take proactive measures to retain customers and minimize revenue loss.

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and codebase for building a customer churn prediction model using machine learning techniques. It offers a step-by-step walkthrough from data collection and preprocessing to model building and evaluation.

## Overview

- **Data Collection**: We collect historical customer data, which includes features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and customer interactions.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing is a crucial step where we clean and transform the data to make it suitable for model training. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

- **Model Building**: We develop and train machine learning models to predict customer churn. We experiment with various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks to find the best-performing model.

- **Evaluation**: The performance of the churn prediction model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. We also visualize the results to gain insights into model performance.

- **Deployment**: Once we have a satisfactory model, we discuss deployment options, including integrating it into existing systems or creating a standalone application for real-time predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

This section describes how to use the code in this repository.

1. **Data Collection**: Download or import your customer churn dataset and place it in the `data/` directory. Ensure that the dataset contains relevant features, including a target variable indicating churn status.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Open the Jupyter Notebook `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` and follow the steps to preprocess your data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. **Model Building**: Use the Jupyter Notebook `Model_Building.ipynb` to build and train your churn prediction model. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best model.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate your model's performance using the metrics and visualizations provided in the evaluation notebook.

5. **Deployment**: If you wish to deploy the model, follow the deployment instructions in the `Deployment` directory.

## Data

In this repository, you will find a sample dataset (`data/churn_data.csv`) that you can use to follow along with the code. However, it is recommended to replace this dataset with your own for real-world applications.

## Model Building

The model building process is documented in the `Model_Building.ipynb` notebook. This notebook includes code examples, explanations, and best practices for building a customer churn prediction model.

## Evaluation

We use various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the churn prediction model. These metrics are explained in detail in the `Evaluation.ipynb` notebook, along with code for visualization.

## Deployment

The deployment of a churn prediction model can vary depending on your specific use case and infrastructure. In the `Deployment` directory, you will find resources and guidance on deploying your model in different environments.
